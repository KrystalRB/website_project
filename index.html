  Why "The Last of Us Part II" is Not a Bad Game

    Marketing/False Advertising
  </h2>

  <p1>
    Many people use the trailer for this game to feel justified in hating it. It includes Joel and Ellie edited to be younger than they are in the actual cut scenes, leading the viewer to believe that Joel is in the game for longer than he is. The team also stated multiple times that Ellie would be the only playable character in the game, which is proven after just a couple short hours of play time. <br> While I agree that the marketing was handled poorly, this should not reflect on the game. It should reflect on Naughty Dog as a company, and shouldn't even be brought up in an analysis or review of the story.
